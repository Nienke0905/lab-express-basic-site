                In this beautifully illustrated collection of her most empowering and outrageous quotes, Gloria shares new thoughts on activism and the role that language can play in inspiring hope and instigating action. Gloria sees quotes as “the poetry of everyday life,” so she has also included a few favorites from friends, including bell hooks, Flo Kennedy, and Michelle Obama.

                Gloria Steinem—writer, activist, organizer, and inspiring leader—now tells a story she has never told before, a candid account of her life as a traveler, a listener, and a catalyst for change. The story served as the inspiration for Julie Taymor’s upcoming movie, The Glorias, set to premier Fall 2020.

                Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions has sold over half a million copies since its original publication in 1983 and was the first published collection of Gloria's essays. Given that she was writing on sexual harassment, genital mutilation, unequal pay for equal work, and other humiliating inequities facing women, she often says that she wishes it hadn't still been relevant enough for a second edition. In 2019, an updated, third version with a foreword by Emma Watson became available.

                  The inside flap of The Beach Book was covered in foil so that the reader could tan his or herself! This was one of Gloria's earliest books and sprang directly from the addiction to travel she still has.
